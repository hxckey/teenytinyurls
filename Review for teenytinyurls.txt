Review for teenytinyurlsSuggested improvements:1. Pipfile is missing.  At the moment, the user has to install the important packages themselves. For example Django would have to be installed by the user.	a. python -m pip install Django2. Would have been great to have a hyperlinked shortened URL3. Would be great to have a way to catch all the incorrect routes with a standard error message4. README was empty
5. When the same url is entered 'Shorter with this long url already exists' appears. It could be better if the link would appear.
6. The styling could be better, like bigger font size, form-button alignment etc.
7. Would be great to have some error handling when the page url is attempted to get shortened
It was great to see the following:1. Code is written in a clean manner and it is easy to read
2. Nice implementation where the url character length is limited to 5 characters
3. Great title
4. Meets the requirements well
5. Django was used well
